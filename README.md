> A simple computer vision bassed indoor human segmentation  

Different background segmentation algorithms based on machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks have emerged in recent years, which significantly improves the accuracy of the algorithm and can cope with increasingly complex scenarios. Human body background segmentation is a branch based on the background segmentation algorithm. Human body background segmentation has a wide range of applications in many scenarios, such as human body detection, anomaly detection, and human body monitoring, such as fall detection, human traffic statistics, security protection, and even video chat software in smartphones nowadays have body segmentation technology. This project is mainly aimed at comparing several background segmentation algorithms, and analyse the performance and result performance of the algorithm, and propose applicable scenarios for the algorithm. And this project is mainly divided into threshold-based segmentation methods and deep learning-based segmentation methods. Frame differencing, MOG, KNN are implemented in the threshold-based method. In the deep learning method, the public dataset from Supervisely is used, and the architecture is **UNet + efficientnet-b4**.
